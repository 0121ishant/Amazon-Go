        "Evaluation of Large language models (LLMs) is often a difficult endeavour: given their broad capabilities, the tasks given to them often should be judged on requirements that would be very broad, and loosely-defined. For instance, an assistant's answer to a question can be:\n",
        "- not grounded in context\n",
        "- repetitive, repetitive, repetitive\n",
        "- grammatically incorrects\n",
        "- Excessively lengthy and characterized by an overabundance of words, leading to a situation where the discourse or written content becomes overly detailed and protracted\n",

        "The list of criteria goes on and on.
